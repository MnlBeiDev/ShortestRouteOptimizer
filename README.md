🚀 **Shortest Route Optimizer**
This solution provides an implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the shortest route between two points in a network of nodes. It is designed with a layered architecture for separation of concerns and reusability. Built using ASP.NET MVC (.NET Framework 4.8), the solution includes:

🌐 **Web Application** (MVC) for interactive user input and route visualization

🛠 **Reusable Class Library** that encapsulates the Dijkstra’s algorithm logic and core models

💻 **Console Application** for quick CLI-based testing or integration in automation scenarios

🔍 **Key Features**
Calculates shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm

Modular and extensible codebase using a layered architecture

Separation of UI, business logic, and data layers for maintainability

Easily pluggable into other .NET Framework projects via the reusable library

🧱 **Tech Stack**
